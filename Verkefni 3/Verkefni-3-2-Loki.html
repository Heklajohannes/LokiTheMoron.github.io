                of aviation,
                there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly.
                Its wings are too small to get
                its fat little body off the ground.
                The bee, of course, flies anyway
                because bees don't care
                what humans think is impossible.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Ooh, black and yellow!
                Let's shake it up a little.
                Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                Ooming!

                How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
                Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine.

            <p style="font-family: Neucha"> Bees, members of the Apidae family, are flying insects that collect 
                nectar and pollen. There are many different types of bees, possibly 20 000 species, and there are 
                many differences between them. Some make honey and some don't. Some can sting, while others can't.
                Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, 
                in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. </p>
