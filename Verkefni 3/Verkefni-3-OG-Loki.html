            <p style="font-family: Grenze"> Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                princess. But she had an enchantment 
                upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                Many brave knights had attempted to 
                free her from this dreadful prison, 
                but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                the tallest tower for her true love 
                and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                a load of - (toilet flush)</p>

                I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
                She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                In the shape of an "L" on her forehead.

            <p class="i_midju" style="font-family: Grenze">Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play!
                Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
                And all that glitters is gold.
                Only shooting stars break the mold.

            <p style="font-family: Grenze">Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming.
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun.
                Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
                So much to do, so much to see.
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
                You'll never shine if you don't glow.

            <p style="font-family: Grenze"> ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
                a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
                and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
                carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
                which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
                up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
                instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
                has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
                walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
                singing the song.</p>
